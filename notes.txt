	alright created the insert player function, the idea is that it will memory allocate a player node, and set its state to the arguments that are  passed, and when we have more than one player we will then begin a secion fucntion that will order them properly,

	so i ran into a problem at line 45 "strcpy(node->playerName,Name);" invloving setting the pointer node's PLayername to the argument that was passed Name, i get the error "Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xc)" what ever that means, i guess the only leading theory i have is the getNewPlayer() function maybe it isnt correcly passing the arguments or something,

	github is being weird rn

8:02pm
	github please work im getting pissed of that it wont update
9:38pm
	alright another look at it and im an idiot on getNewPlayer function, i called input player and set the score as 0, but the parameter of inputPLayer is an array of char, so giving an into to an array will cause problems.
	duh, what an idiot. On God...
	tomorrow try to see if playername is valid to add, also maybe we should you argument int instead, we can parse array char before we give it as an argument for inputPLayer function idk think about it

	I just had a dream, i was working on this program in my dream and i realized that arrays are the way to go, reason being is less code, i can still make it work but i will have xtra functions for linked list, now how would i make the arrays work all i need is a size 5 array, i need a function that reads the file duh, and when the user creates a new player and its guesss, all i need to do is find where the new player lands on the array, now i dont need to update the array i just need to update the file, with the new player, and use my array to complete the rest, once that is done i need to re-read the file, re-use the same functino, to get the updated list, once I get to the library we need a whole new rework.
9:14am
ALRIGHT now i need to handle the array properly to do that i need a function that
first checks if the amout of players in the scoreboard,
we must preset the lowerst score of -1,
	if (newPlayerscore < lowest score), then we check if scoreboard ==5 if so we ignore that score and make no edits
	else{call the function that properly updates the file and resets the array with updated info }
	if ( newplayerscore > lowest score), we need to call function that properly updates the file and resets the array with updated info goes through the array and checks if the sore of newplayer is greater than if so we stop the now and
	
10:01am, after arriving at the library, i inputed those inputs and all i need is to handle it. now i realized i havent even made the game, like where is the data to indert i should have started with that, what an idiot...

	1:00pm shit i forgot about this, what i need to do is write an algo to properly inserts the new board, i need to fix the bug, of name input, i need to make sure readfile() works and i need to write writeFile() function
	
	1:33pm ok, algo done, bugs fixed, and readfile() kinda works, it doesn read anything above line 1, need to figure that out. and need to make writeFile() also check if the readfile correctly makes a champions.txt file and see if we can imply direction, like instead of /user/hj/document/.... its just 'champions.txt"
	also i suspect that i can reducde the readFile() but idk, think about it......
