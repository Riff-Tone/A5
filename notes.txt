	alright created the insert player function, the idea is that it will memory allocate a player node, and set its state to the arguments that are  passed, and when we have more than one player we will then begin a secion fucntion that will order them properly,

	so i ran into a problem at line 45 "strcpy(node->playerName,Name);" invloving setting the pointer node's PLayername to the argument that was passed Name, i get the error "Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xc)" what ever that means, i guess the only leading theory i have is the getNewPlayer() function maybe it isnt correcly passing the arguments or something,

	github is being weird rn

	github please work im getting pissed of that it wont update

	alright another look at it and im an idiot on getNewPlayer function, i called input player and set the score as 0, but the parameter of inputPLayer is an array of char, so giving an into to an array will cause problems.
	duh, what an idiot. On God...
	tomorrow try to see if playername is valid to add, also maybe we should you argument int instead, we can parse array char before we give it as an argument for inputPLayer function idk think about it
